# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains Python projects and assignments for my **Spring 2025 Data Mining** course. Each folder corresponds to a specific homework or exercise, showcasing various data mining techniques and concepts.

## Contents

### `homework5`
- **Description**: Implements a comparison of classifiers (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and SVM) across multiple datasets.
- **Key Features**:
  - Computes win-loss-draw statistics for classifiers.
  - Uses statistical tests to compare classifier performance.
- **Main File**: `main.py`

### `homework6`
- **Description**: Visualizes itemset lattices for frequent itemset mining.
- **Key Features**:
  - Constructs hierarchical graphs for itemsets.
  - Differentiates frequent, infrequent, and non-candidate itemsets using color-coded nodes.
- **Main File**: `main.py`
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`.

### `homework8/ch6_ex12`
- **Description**: Analyzes association rules using contingency tables and ranks rules based on support, confidence, and interest.
- **Key Features**:
  - Computes support, confidence, and interest for association rules.
  - Visualizes rankings using bar charts.
